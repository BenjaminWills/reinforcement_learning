# Reinforcement Learning

Welcome to my repository in which I experiment with reinforcement learning techniques. 

See my notion notes for any context or theory: https://www.notion.so/Reinforcement-learning-dd3a6c0bda69465dabea123a30007bd8?pvs=4.

## Simulations

| Simulations | Description | Implemented |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Gamblers problem | The gamblers problem simulation is a game in which a gambler bets on a biased coin, if the coin lands on heads the gambler gains the bet, otherwise they lose the bet. The gambler continues betting until they reach £100 or £0. | ✅ |
| Cartpole | The Cartpole simulation is a classic control problem in reinforcement learning. The goal is to balance a pole on a cart by applying appropriate forces to the cart. | ❌ |
| Mountain Car | The Mountain Car simulation is another classic control problem in reinforcement learning. The goal is to drive a car up a steep mountain by applying appropriate forces to the car. | ❌ |
| Gridworld | The Gridworld simulation is a simple grid-based environment where an agent can move in four directions (up, down, left, right). The agent's goal is to navigate to a specific location while avoiding obstacles. | ❌ |
| Taxi | The Taxi simulation is a grid-based environment where an agent acts as a taxi driver. The agent's goal is to pick up passengers and drop them off at their desired locations while following traffic rules. | ❌ |
| Breakout | The Breakout simulation is a classic arcade game where the player controls a paddle to bounce a ball and break bricks. The goal is to clear all the bricks by hitting them with the ball. | ❌ |
| Pong | The Pong simulation is a classic arcade game where the player controls a paddle to hit a ball back and forth with an opponent. The goal is to score points by making the opponent miss the ball. | ❌ |
| Seven state random walk | A 7 state random walk wherein we can go up and down at a fixed probability. | ✅ |
| Blackjack | A game with 13 cards, in which the aim is for the sum of a players hand to be as close to 21 as possible from below. | ✅ |
